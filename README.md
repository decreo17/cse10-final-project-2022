## Destroy the Death Star Game

Welcome to the Destroy the Death Star game! You can't let the empire win! There are 2 players who will try to destroy the death star and the incoming fleet of the Empire. Each player will use their lazers to destroy their enemies, but be careful not to hit your partner or you'll lose. You must destroy all of the ships of the Empire as fast as possible so you get back to the rebel alliance. Think quick, be smart, don't get hit, and may the force be with you.
